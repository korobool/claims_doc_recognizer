  You are processing a GENERAL DOCUMENT of unknown type.

  Since the document type is not specifically recognized, focus on:
  - Extracting any clearly identifiable information
  - Preserving the document structure
  - Correcting obvious OCR errors
  - Identifying key entities (names, dates, amounts)

  Be conservative in your corrections - only fix clear OCR errors.
